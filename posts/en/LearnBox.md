_This blog post is only a quick description of the project, I'll later provide a more inn depth code analysis_

This webApp was a way for me to learn ReactJS, I started it with javascript but quickly refactored it to use Typescript Instead. It uses Django + DRF in the backend and Tailwind for the styling.

It's a webAPP that let you create a "LearnBox" which is a box based on a particular topic that contains different informations, that could be video or text based, you can also add your personal Markdown notes alongside them to help others iunderstand why you think a given source is valuable. You can choose also choose to keep your boxes private if you're not yet ready to share them. Otherwise Public Boxs can be downloaded by anyone, and why not shared a second time after modification.
